# Description

Development of AI audio app to compare the cough of a Coronavirus (COVID-19) infected individual with the cough of an uninfected individual.

# End-goal

The purpose of this application is to provide the global community with an application through which the user can upload a clip of themselves or a loved-one coughing to a machine-learning platform which analyzes the cough and determines the likelihood that the user is infected with COVID-19 as well as the other potentially crucial meta information such as the potential severity of the infection, likelihood of accompanying health concerns, etc.

## Phases of implementation

### Development of MVP

The first step of this project will be to develop the Minimum Viable Product for this application and get it to market so that end-users can begin to upload data to.

  - [Figma Prototype]()

### Data Gathering & ML Processing

The second step is to onboard as many users as feasible (both uninfected and infected individuals) and setup machine learning capabilities within the application, which processes audio clips uploaded to discern discrepancies between the coughs of an infected individuals and the coughs of an uninfected individual.

### COVID-19 Detection Application

Pivot the application to return predictions based on audio files uploaded once confidence level in ML Processing is high enough.
