# Getting Involved / Onboarding

Thank you for being interested in getting helping out with our project, this document will detail the steps you need to take.

## What help we need

* **Front-End Engineers:**

  We have lots of code to write!
  For our MVP, we're focusing on delivering a mobile-first web app, and our stack is React, Redux, TypeScript and Firebase.
  If you have experience with these technologies, your help is greatly wanted.

* **Partnership Communication / Outreach:**

  Related to the **Organization Research** role above,
  we need someone to manage communication with each of the organizations or
  groups that we will be interacting with.

* **Community Managers:**

  We have a users joining our Slack almost every day and hoping to volunteer for the project.
  We need someone to warmly welcome newcomers to the project, and ensure there is as little friction as possible for people,
  and that they are able to provide valuable contributions as quickly as possible!

  **Responsibilities:**

  * Help engage and onboard incoming volunteers
  * Work with social media managers to generate social content that will drive communications

* **Legal**:

  We need help writing our Privacy Policies, leading GDPR compliance efforts
  etc...

* **Social Media Manager**:

  We would like someone to join our marketing team to head up our presence on
  social media (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn), including:
  * Creating content to share
  * Publishing and scheduling posts
  * Responding to interactions on our accounts

## Initial Onboarding Steps

  - Join our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/open-covid19/shared_invite/zt-cbji2hte-8jdoHpJDKg80ZliPVCIjqw)
  - Then fill out [our onboarding form](https://airtable.com/....).
  - Participate using our [Public Trello board](https://trello.com/opencovid19aicoughdetectionteam)
  - After that, it's time to join a team...

## Joining a [Team](TEAMS.md)

Lots of people are working on this project at the same time,
so we try our best to explicitly assign tasks to individuals
to reduce the likelihood of duplicated or wasted effort.
To help with this, we are organized into [teams](TEAMS.md).

We don't require you to be part of a team for all tasks,
but this is preferable,
and certain core tasks (such as frontend development)
do require you to be on the team.

Once you have filled out the onboarding form (above),
we will try to reach out with you soon after with details
of what team we'd like you to join, and how we'd like you to contribute.
If we seem to take too long with this (it happens, we're all volunteering),
or if there is a particular team you're interested in joining,
feel free to reach out to the lead of that team on Slack
to express your interest.

## Meetings

There are currently a number of recurring meetings to keep progress on the
project moving forward.
We are using Google Meet at the moment to facilitate these meetings.

* **Leads Meeting - Every Weekday, 4pm UTC**

  Meeting for the leads team. Meetings are recorded and notes are taken and made
  publicly available (see **Meeting Notes Google Drive folder** below).

* **Technical Stand-Up - Every ???, 5pm UTC**

  Meeting for all people actively working on ux, design & development,
  quickly summarizing tasks everyone is working on,
  any blockers,
  and anything else that everyone needs to be aware of.

  This meeting is open to all contributors,
  joining details are posted in team channels at the start of each meeting.
